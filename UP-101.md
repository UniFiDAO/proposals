## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the UP.-->
Launch Althea Peggy with an ERCO20 bi-directional token bridge on the CosmosHub by December 31, 2020.

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the project and the objective feature to be released.-->
Peggy has been long overdue as a production CosmosHub feature. Peggy is a key step in delivering the promise of the Inter Blockchain Protocol. An Ethereum Peggy bridge has not yet launched. This shortfall prevents the CosmosHub ATOM holders from participating in the current DeFi wave. Currently Peggy is being developed by one full time developer and one part time developer. The current team consists of Justin Kilpatrick on relayer and Cosmos-SDK tasks and Jehan Tremback on Solidity tasks. The goal of this proposal is to acquire funding for full time solidity development and a full time Cosmos-SDK expert to ship a functioning Peggy for the CosmosHub by December 31, 2021. All personnel are ready to start immediately.

## Value Proposition
<!-- What are the key value propositions and motivation for the features proposed.-->
Peggy delivers proposition to the CosmosHub and ATOM holders from a functioning Ethereum and Peggy bi-directional bridge to be substantial for the following reason.

1. Successfully launching the first version Peggy on the CosmosHub is a massive win for CosmosHub. For the first time, The CosmosHub users will be able to create transfer ERC30 tokens from Ethereum blockchain for use on the Cosmos blockchain, delivering on a major promise of the Cosmos universe’s interchain functionality.

2. ATOM holders have already paid for Peggy delivery, but are still waiting for a production-ready product. This proposal will include product management support to ensure that Peggy is delivered with a proposal to upgrade the CosmosHub with the first version of this software.

3. Peggy will be open source software, available for use on any chain in the Cosmos ecosystem. We are confident that Peggy’s production code delivery will enable a number of new applications and opportunities in the Cosmos ecosystem and reflects the value proposition of the UniFi DAO members.


## Features
<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Cosmos Clients.-->
The technical specification should describe the key requirements for the new features. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Cosmos clients.

## Rationale
<!--The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

## Implementation
<!--The implementations must be completed before any UP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the UP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.-->

## Security Considerations
<!--All UPs must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for security discussions, surfaces risks and can be used throughout the life cycle of the proposal. E.g. include security-relevant design decisions, concerns, important discussions, implementation-specific guidance and pitfalls, an outline of threats and risks and how they are being addressed. UP submissions missing the "Security Considerations" section will be rejected. An UP cannot proceed to status "Final" without a Security Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers.-->

## Milestones
<!-- What is the launch schedule for this feature and the milestones on the roadmap?-->
The Milestones for accelerated Peggy launch are as follows:

* **October Milestone: Bi-Directional ERC20 support**
  * ERC20’s must originate on Ethereum, no assets can originate on Cosmos
  * ERC20 token is hardcoded in the bridge contract
  * Deployment procedure will require a chain halt.

* **November Milestone: Bi-Directional ERC20 support**
  * ERC20’s must originate on Ethereum, no assets can originate on Cosmos
  * ERC20 token is hardcoded in the bridge contract
  * CosmosHub Proposal for Peggy module
  * Deployment procedure will require a chain halt.
  * Multiple ERC20’s using a single bridgewith runtime addition of new tokens.
  * Validator Daemon support for secure key storage mechanisms
  * ERC20’s must originate on Ethereum, no assets can originate on Cosmos

* **December Milestone: Cosmos -> Ethereum asset support**
  * Separate bridge contract into validators set and subcontracts.
  * Subcontracts for multiple ERC20 input
  * Subcontracts implementing ERC20 to
  * create representations of ATOM or some other asset


## Deliverable
<!-- What is the expected deliverable that will be launched?-->
There will be two Peggy versions that will be delivered:

* **Peggy v1:** Single ERC20 support and Multiple runtime ERC20 support in November. Peggy will be ready to deploy but requires chain halt. In this context Multiple ERC20 means you can send DAI and USDT to the contract and both would end up on Cosmos. 

* **Peggy v2:** Peggy v2 includes support for sending Cosmos assets, such as Atom over to Ethereum. This requires significant new engineering work around the solidity contracts.

* **Documentation & tooling:** Althea will provide developer documentation and automation for deploying and interacting with the Peggy bridge. It is our goal that this documentation be brief as Peggy’s deployment process should be mostly automated and easy for even a small zone to use. Likewise developer tooling for Peggy will be provided in Rust and Javascript. Obviously GO tooling will be provided by CosmosSDK code.
