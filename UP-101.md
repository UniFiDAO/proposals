## Simple Summary

<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the UP.-->

Launch Althea Peggy with an ERC20 bi-directional token bridge on the CosmosHub by December 31, 2020.

## Abstract

<!--A short (~200 word) description of the project and the objective feature to be released.-->

Peggy has been long overdue as a production CosmosHub feature. Peggy is a key step in delivering the promise of the Inter Blockchain Protocol. An Ethereum Peggy bridge has not yet launched. This shortfall prevents the CosmosHub ATOM holders from participating in the current DeFi wave. Currently Peggy is being developed by one full time developer and one part time developer. The current team consists of Justin Kilpatrick on relayer and Cosmos-SDK tasks and Jehan Tremback on Solidity tasks. The goal of this proposal is to acquire funding for full time solidity development and a full time Cosmos-SDK expert to ship a functioning Peggy for the CosmosHub by December 31, 2021. All personnel are ready to start immediately.

## Value Proposition

<!-- What are the key value propositions and motivation for the features proposed.-->

Peggy delivers a major value proposition to the CosmosHub and ATOM holders. Cosmos will have a functioning Ethereum and Cosmos bi-directional bridge that will allow ERC20 tokens on Ethereum to be created on the CosmosHub.

1. Successfully launching the first version Peggy on the CosmosHub is a massive win for CosmosHub. For the first time, The CosmosHub users will be able to create transfer ERC20 tokens from Ethereum blockchain for use on the Cosmos blockchain, delivering on a major promise of the Cosmos universe’s interchain functionality.

2. ATOM holders have already paid for Peggy delivery, but are still waiting for a production-ready product. This proposal will include product management support to ensure that Peggy is delivered with a proposal to upgrade the CosmosHub with the first version of this software.

3. Peggy will be open source software, available for use on any chain in the Cosmos ecosystem. We are confident that Peggy’s production code delivery will enable a number of new applications and opportunities in the Cosmos ecosystem and reflects the value proposition of the UniFi DAO members.

## Features

<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Cosmos Clients.-->

The technical specification should describe the key requirements for the new features. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Cosmos clients.

## Rationale

<!--The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

## Implementation

<!--The implementations must be completed before any UP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the UP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.-->

## Security Considerations

<!--All UPs must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for security discussions, surfaces risks and can be used throughout the life cycle of the proposal. E.g. include security-relevant design decisions, concerns, important discussions, implementation-specific guidance and pitfalls, an outline of threats and risks and how they are being addressed. UP submissions missing the "Security Considerations" section will be rejected. An UP cannot proceed to status "Final" without a Security Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers.-->

## Milestones

<!-- What is the launch schedule for this feature and the milestones on the roadmap?-->

The Milestones for accelerated Peggy launch are as follows:

- **Peggy Test: Target October 2020**

  - ERC20’s must originate on Ethereum, no assets can originate on Cosmos
  - A single ERC20 token is hardcoded in the bridge contract. The bridge can only move this asset
  - The primary goal of this milestone is to complete a minimal working system end to end and find unexpected problems.

- **Peggy V1: Target November 2020**

  - ERC20’s must originate on Ethereum, no assets can originate on Cosmos
  - CosmosHub Proposal for Peggy module
  - Multiple ERC20’s using a single bridge with runtime addition of new tokens.
  - Validator Daemon support for secure key storage mechanisms

- **Peggy V2: Target January 2020**
  - Combined support for assets originating on Cosmos as well as assets originating on Ethereum
  - Solidity contract will be split into contracts for issuing representations of Cosmos assets, a contract for managing incoming Ethereum assets, and a contract for managing the validator state.

## Deliverables

<!-- What is the expected deliverable that will be launched?-->

There will be two Peggy versions that will be delivered:

### Peggy V1

**Summary:** Single ERC20 support and Multiple runtime ERC20 support in November. In this context Multiple ERC20 means you can send DAI and USDT to the contract and both would end up on Cosmos.

**Details**

Solidity Contract

- Locks tokens and emits an event
- Unlocks tokens on properly signed validated transaction batch
- Allows for updating the validator set on properly signed validator update
- Pays out tx batch fees to the relayer on the Ethereum side.

Cosmos Module

- Burning of ERC20 representation funds on the Cosmos side to release on Ethereum
- Fee collection while performing token burning
- Processing and validation of validator set updates for the Ethereum Contact
- Processing and validation of oracle attestations
- Issuing of tokens for bridged assets once oracle attestations are complete
- API for sending ERC20 token representation back to Ethereum
- Creation of transaction batches to be relayed to Ethereum

Validator Daemon

- Signing and submission of Validator set updates
- Signing and submission of Transaction batches
- Support for KMS
- Observation of Ethereum and relaying of events

Automated testing

- Creates Ethereum testnet
- Deploys Solidity contract to that Ethereum testnet
- Creates Cosmos testnet running Peggy
- Sends test transactions back and forth
- All runs in docker from a single start script

### Peggy V2

**Summary** Peggy v2 includes support for sending Cosmos assets, such as Atom over to Ethereum. This requires significant new engineering work around the solidity contracts.

**Details**
Solidity Contract

- Separate Validator set, from Ethereum and from Cosmos contracts
- 'From Cosmos' contract implements ERC20 and calls out to the validator set contract to issue or burn tokens.
- 'From Ethereum' contract is the same as Peggy V1 except it too calls out to the validator
  set update contract

Cosmos Module

- Governance actions for deploying a new ERC20 'from cosmos' solidity contract
- API for sending Cosmos native assets

Validator Daemon

- Management of multiple Ethereum contracts
- Transaction oracle across many contracts

Automated testing

- Expanded to include transactions originating on Cosmos

**Documentation & tooling:** Althea will provide developer documentation and automation for deploying and interacting with the Peggy bridge. It is our goal that this documentation be brief as Peggy’s deployment process should be mostly automated and easy for even a small zone to use. Likewise developer tooling for Peggy will be provided in Rust and Javascript. Obviously GO tooling will be provided by CosmosSDK code.

## Offering Type

<!--What is your proposed funding structure-->

Cosmos community and UniFi DAO members are offered a membership to PeggyJV, a joint venture entity that will launch Peggy on the hub and begin commercialization of the Peggy bridge technology. Membership subscriptions are for the lifetime membership in a new joint venture called PeggyJV. PeggyJV will be a US entity that will launch Peggy on Cosmos and continue to monetize Peggy bridges across Cosmos and the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem.

**Membership Benefits:** Subscribers to the PeggyJV will receive access to PeggyJV internal commercial opprtunities for Peggy and will have an opportunity to invest directly into the PeggyJV in return for tokens or equity. The Membership is NOT an investment. It is purchase of access to participate in the commercialization of Peggy bridges.

**Membership Fee:** 2,000 ATOMs per member.

**Minimum Memberships:** 15 Memberships

If the minimum membership subscription of 15 memberships is not met, the funds to the wallet multisig will be returned to all addresses.
