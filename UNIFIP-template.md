<!--You can leave these HTML comments in your merged UNIFIP and delete the visible duplicate text guides, they will not appear and may be helpful to refer to if you edit it again.

This is the suggested template for new UNIFIPs. It was inspired by Ethereum's EIP and Bitcoin's BIPs.

## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the UNIFIP.-->

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the project and the objective feature to be released.-->
A short (~200 word) description of your project and the features to be launched.

## Value Proposition
<!-- What are the key value propositions and motiviation for the feeatures proposed.-->
The value proposition and the motivation is critical for UNIFIPs that want to launch new features and prodcuts in the Cosmos. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the UNIFIP solves. UNIFIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.

## Specification
<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Cosmos Clients.-->
The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Cosmos clients.

## Rationale
<!--The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

## Implementation
<!--The implementations must be completed before any UNIFIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the UNIFIP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.-->

## Security Considerations
<!--All UNIFIPs must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for security discussions, surfaces risks and can be used throughout the life cycle of the proposal. E.g. include security-relevant design decisions, concerns, important discussions, implementation-specific guidance and pitfalls, an outline of threats and risks and how they are being addressed. UNIFIP submissions missing the "Security Considerations" section will be rejected. An UNIFIP cannot proceed to status "Final" without a Security Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers.-->
